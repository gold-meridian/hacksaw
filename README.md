# hacksaw

---

**hacksaw** is a HashLink VM implementation aiming to run HashLink binaries on .NET.

---

This project is adapted from and spiritually a continuation of [sharplink](https://github.com/steviegt6/sharplink), which much of the deserialization code has been reused from.

- Certain techniques and changes have been taken from the [dead-cells-core-modding fork](https://github.com/dead-cells-core-modding/core/tree/main/sources/HashlinkNET.Bytecode).
